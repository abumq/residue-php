# Residue PHP Client
A very simple, secure PHP library to interact with residue seamlessly.

This library provides interface for connecting and interacting with residue server seamlessly, means, once you are connected this module takes care of expired tokens and clients and keep itself updated with latest tokens and ping server when needed to stay alive.

 * `nc` (netcat)

Please check out [sample configuration](/samples/client.conf.json) to find out more

## Progress
This library does not currently support following features:

// initialize only once in the beginning of the script
\residue\Residue::init("/path/to/client.conf.json");

$logger = new \residue\Logger("sample-app");

// we're all set! (if everything was good in client.conf.json file)

$logger->debug("another");

// array
$logger->info([1, 2]);

// object
$logger->info("blah %s this", $myCar);

// number
$logger->info(1234);
$logger->info(1234.233);

// formatted (see http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php)
$logger->info("test %s %s", 1, 2);


// verbose log
$logger->verbose(9, "this is msg %d ---", 123);

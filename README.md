# Residue PHP Client
A very simple, secure PHP library to interact with residue seamlessly.

This library provides interface for connecting and interacting with residue server seamlessly, means, once you are connected this module takes care of expired tokens and clients and keep itself updated with latest tokens and ping server when needed to stay alive.

 * Time offset with log message
 * Custom key size
 * Reset connection when server restarted or reset
